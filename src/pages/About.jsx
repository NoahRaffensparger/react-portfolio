      <p class="about-me">
        Hello! I am a junior full-stack developer from Minnesota with a passion for building dynamic and engaging web applications. I began coding summer of 2024 when I enrolled in the University of Minnesota's Coding Bootcamp. During this intensive program, I learned skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including a wide range of technologies like React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and many more. Each project I worked on taught me something new, from designing aesthetic and responsive front-end pages to developing detailed and reliable back-end systems.

       I love travelling. I've lived in Minnesota for my entire life, and me and my partner love driving up to Duluth to enjoy the scenery. The weather of Duluth inspired Mark Twain to say: "the coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in Duluth". Despite the cold, we fell in love with watching the boats come in off Lake Superior, waving as they pass beneath the Aerial Lift Bridge, going to the fudge shop for a sweet treat, and hiking the beautiful trails.

        I also enjoy playing tennis. There's nothing like hitting a sweet backhand down the line. My favorite tennis player is Rafael Nadal. Over the course of 23 years, Rafa has achieved over 90 professional tennis titles. He is an inspiration to me, not for his ability to play tennis, but because of his mental strength. For Rafa, it's about giving each moment your all, focusing on the present, working to improve yourself, and remembering to enjoy the journey. I try to mimic this mentality in my personal and professional life.
